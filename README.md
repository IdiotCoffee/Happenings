# Happenings

Happenings is a website that helps students find and register for new college events. This project was created as part of a hackathon, where we developed it in a team of four using basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- **Event Calendar**: A calendar to track and add events, allowing students to stay organized with their college activities.
- **Upcoming Events Showcase**: A section that highlights upcoming events, making it easy for students to find and register for new opportunities.

## About the Project

This project was our first hackathon experience, and we aimed to create a simple yet functional platform that would be useful for college students. The focus was on building a user-friendly interface and ensuring that the website was easy to navigate.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the content on the website.
- **CSS**: For styling the website and ensuring a visually appealing design.
- **JavaScript**: For adding interactivity and handling dynamic features like the event calendar.
